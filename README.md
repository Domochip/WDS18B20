# WirelessDS18B20

This project use an ESP8266 and some DS18B20 sensors on a 1-Wire bus to provide temperatures :
 - in JSON format (answer HTTP queries)
 - by publishing to an MQTT broker

It is possible to get list of DS18B20 ROMcodes available on the bus or current temperature of a sensor by HTTP.
All sensors temperatures are published regularly on MQTT topics.

## Build your 1-Wire bus

In order to get a wide 1-Wire bus (one that cover a house), Dallas provides some recommendations into their application note AN148.

This project use the Improved Interface bellow that is able to support a 200m bus:

![Dallas AN148 ImprovedCPUBusInterface schema](https://raw.github.com/Domochip/WirelessDS18B20/master/img/AN148-ImprovedCPUBusInterface.jpg)

This one requires a pin for reading the bus state and another one as output to drive the bus low : I named it the "Dual Pin OneWire"

**Warning : If you build a large 1 Wire bus inside your house, keep in mind that some high voltage may appear on this one by induction. You need to have a good knowledge about electricity and associated risks!!!**

## Build your WirelessDS18B20

All files are inside schematic subfolder and has been designed with KiCad

### Code/Compile

Source code can be compiled using VisualStudioCode/Platformio and flashed onto a D1 Mini

### Print your box

Box project (Fusion 360) can be found into `box` folder

## Run

### First Boot

During First Boot, the ESP boot in Access Point Mode

- Network SSID : `WirelessDSXXXX`
- Password : `PasswordDS`
- ESP IP : `192.168.4.1`

Connect to this network and then configure it.

### Configuration

WirelessDS18B20 offers you some webpages in order to configure it :

- `Status` return you the current status of the module :

![status screenshot](https://raw.github.com/Domochip/WirelessDS18B20/master/img/status.png)

- `Config` allows you to change configuration :

![config screenshot](https://raw.github.com/Domochip/WirelessDS18B20/master/img/config.png)

- **ssid & password** : IDs of your Wifi Network
- **hostname** : name of ESP on the network
- **IP,GW,NetMask,DNS1&2** : Fixed IP configuration


![config3 screenshot](https://raw.github.com/Domochip/WirelessDS18B20/master/img/config3.png)

- **HA Type** : None (HTTP GET only) or MQTT
- **SSL/TLS** : check if your MQTT server enforce SSL/TLS
- **Hostname** : IP or DNS name of your MQTT server
- **Upload Period** : Period in seconds betwwen each MQTT send
- **MQTT Type** : describe the structure of the topic end
- **Port** : MQTT Port
- **Username/Password** : MQTT Username/Password (both are optionnal)
- **Base Topic** : Prefix of the topic

- `Firmware` allows you to flash a new firmware version :

- `Discover` allows you to find all DomoChip devices on your network :

## Use it

### Basics

Usage (answers are in JSON format):

- `http://IP/getL` will return list of DS18B20 ROMCodes available on the 1-Wire bus number 0
- `http://IP/getT?ROMCode=0A1B2C3D4E5F6071` will return simple JSON with temperature from the sensor

### With Jeedom (HTTP GET Method)

> Memento : Jeedom is an innovative home automation system that can be found at <http://jeedom.com>

For this configuration you need the *Script* plugin installed from the market :

![Script Icon](https://raw.github.com/Domochip/WirelessDS18B20/master/img/JeedomScriptIcon.png)

Go to script plugin then add a new equipment:

![Script Add](https://raw.github.com/Domochip/WirelessDS18B20/master/img/JeedomScriptAdd.png)

Name it :

![Script Name](https://raw.github.com/Domochip/WirelessDS18B20/master/img/JeedomScriptName.png)

Set refresh time (every minutes in my case) :

![Script Refresh](https://raw.github.com/Domochip/WirelessDS18B20/master/img/JeedomScriptRefresh.png)

Then into command tab, add a script command :

![Script Command](https://raw.github.com/Domochip/WirelessDS18B20/master/img/JeedomScriptAddCmd.png)

Then set it up with :

- command name : Temperature
- script type : JSON
- request : Temperature (JSON tag name)
- URL : `http://**IP**/getT?ROMCode=**0A1B2C3D4E5F6071**`
- Unit : Â°C

![Script Command Config](https://raw.github.com/Domochip/WirelessDS18B20/master/img/JeedomScriptCmdConfig.png)

Now you're done and should get something like this :
